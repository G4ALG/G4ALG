Hi, my name is Steve Rawlings @G4ALG

I’m interested in developing Arduino projects and am currently learning C++ and how to make best use of the Arduino Nano.

I’m looking to collaborate with the development of a radio frequency (RF) digitally synthesised (DDS) variable frequency oscillator (VFO) for use in amateur radio transmitters.
