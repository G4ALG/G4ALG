My name is Steve Rawlings (G4ALG) and I live in Lydney, England.

I'm interested in developing Arduino projects and am currently learning C++ and how to make best use of the Arduino Nano.

I'd be pleased to collaborate with others with an interest in developing digitally synthesised (DDS) variable frequency oscillators (VFOs) for use in amateur radio transmitters.
